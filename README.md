A benefit of this project is the reduction of customer service costs and the ability to provide much faster and more accessible responses to customers, within the site itself.

## Minimum Viable Product
At minimum:
- The chatbot should have a quality user interface that is customizable and easy to use.
- The chatbot should include a quick and easy fine tuning process, allowing developers to easily customize the it to fit the needs of their website.
- The API should provide rate limiting and a high level of security to prevent abuse.
