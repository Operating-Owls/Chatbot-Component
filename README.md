# Chatbot-Component
This is a chatbot component designed to be used in nextjs projects.  It is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a chatbot component that can be easily integrated into any nextjs project. The focus is to create a developer-friendly component that can be easily customized and styled to fit the needs of any website.  A benefit of this project is the reduction of customer service costs and the ability to provide much faster and more accessible responses to customers, within the site itself.

## Minimum Viable Product
At minimum:
- The chatbot should have a quality user interface that is customizable and easy to use.
- The chatbot should include a quick and easy fine tuning process, allowing developers to easily customize the it to fit the needs of their website.
- The API should provide rate limiting and a high level of security to prevent abuse.

## OpenAI Pricing Evaluation
GPT-3.5 is an inexpensive model and supports the function of chat applications. One token is roughly 4 characters for standard English text. With $10 funded into the account, testing is covered for over hundreds of thousands of words.
